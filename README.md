# VS-Bruno

**VS-Bruno** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to provide a graphical interface for `.bru` files, used by [Bruno](https://usebruno.com/) — an open-source HTTP client. It reads and displays `.bru` API definitions in a clean, customizable visual editor, allowing you to modify requests, parameters, and bodies directly from within VSCode.
